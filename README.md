# Yummy
Simple food planner app made using SwiftUI.

The idea behind the app is to browse variety of different meals of all types, find their ingredients and the preparation instructions and to be able to add those meals to our favorite meals list or to our plan for a specific day and slowly build our nutrition plan for the whole week.

Technologies used in the app:

1- SwiftUI

2- MVVM Architecture

3- SwiftData for caching

4- YouTubePlayerKit to play the instructions video inside the app

5- Other CocoaPods including KingFisher, LottieAnimation
